## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

AGILE VS WATERFALL METHODOLOGIES

AGILE
Approach - Iterative, flexible 
Planning - Adaptive, continuous 
Development - Divided into sprints (2-4 weeks)
Flexibility - High Flexibility
Testing - 	Continuous throughout
Client Involvement - Ongoing feedback

Agile Advantages:
-Faster delivery with working software in each sprint.
-Adapts easily to changing requirements.
-Continuous feedback improves quality.

Agile Disadvantages:
-Requires close team collaboration and discipline.
-It can lead to scope creep if it is not managed properly.
-Less suited for strict regulatory environments.

WATERFALL
Approach - Sequential, structured
Planning - Fixed, detailed upfront
Development - One long phase at a time
Flexibility - Low Flexibility
Testing - Done after development
Client Involvement - Involved mainly at the start & end

Waterfall Advantages:
-Clear structure with well-documented phases.
-It works well for projects with fixed requirements.
-Easier to estimate time and costs.

Waterfall Disadvantages:
-Hard to adapt once development starts.
-Late testing increases the risk of discovering major issues late.
-Requires thorough planning, leaving little room for change.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall

Agile is Best For:
-Dynamic, fast-changing projects where requirements evolve.
-Customer-driven software needing frequent updates.
-Complex, innovative projects requiring experimentation.

For example:
-Mobile App Development: Features change based on user feedback.
-Startup MVP (Minimum Viable Product): Rapid iterations to refine the product.
-AI/ML Projects: Continuous learning and model adjustments.

Waterfall is Best For:
Well-defined, stable projects with fixed requirements.
Regulated industries needing strict documentation and approvals.
Large-scale system integrations where predictability is key.

Example:
Banking Software: Requires compliance with strict regulations.
Infrastructure Projects: For example, airport security systems are where safety is critical.
Government Contracts: Fixed scope, budget, and long-term planning.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods for Quality Assurance
-Automated Testing – Use unit, integration, and regression tests to catch bugs early.
-Manual Testing – Conduct functional, exploratory, and usability tests.
-Code Reviews – Peer reviews ensure clean, maintainable code.
-Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) – Automate builds and tests to detect issues quickly.
-User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validate software with real users before release
-Performance & Security Testing – Ensure scalability, speed, and security compliance.

Importance of High QA Standards
-Prevents Costly Bugs – Fixing issues early saves time and money.
-Enhances User Experience – Reliable software improves customer satisfaction.
-Ensures Security & Compliance – Critical for financial, healthcare, and enterprise applications.
-Builds Reputation – High-quality software earns trust and credibility.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Clearly defining the project scope ensures:
-Clear Objectives – Prevents misunderstandings and scope creep.
-Resource Efficiency – Allocates time, budget, and manpower effectively.
-Risk Mitigation – Identifies potential challenges early.
-Stakeholder Alignment – Ensures everyone agrees on deliverables.

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It organizes work into phases,
deliverables, and subtasks, making it easier to track progress and allocate resources.

Why is WBS Useful?
-Improves Planning – Defines tasks, dependencies, and timeframes.
-Enhances Team Coordination – Assigns clear responsibilities.
-Facilitates Tracking – Helps monitor progress and adjust schedules.
-Reduces Complexity – Simplifies large projects into structured components.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:
-Clear Timeline – Defines task durations and deadlines.
-Efficient Resource Allocation – Ensures proper distribution of manpower and tools.
-Better Risk Management – Identifies potential delays early.
-Improved Team Coordination – Keeps everyone aligned on milestones.
-Enhanced Productivity – Reduces downtime and prevents last-minute rushes.

How Gantt Charts Help:
-Visual Timeline – Displays tasks, dependencies, and progress.
-Task Dependencies – Shows which tasks must be completed before others.
-Milestone Tracking – Highlights key project phases.
-Progress Monitoring – Helps ensure the project stays on track.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
